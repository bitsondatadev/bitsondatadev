My primary interests are in the underlying algorithms of ⚙️🗄️ database systems, 💽🔎 data analytics, and 📈📊 data visualization.

I enjoy playing guitar🎸, maps/GIS systems🗺️, oxford commas🔣, and long walks on the beach🏖️.

I served six years in the Marine Corps and got out with an honorable discharge as a Sergeant. During that time my job was to maintain data communications 📡 through networking systems for a battalion for field operations. Experiencing the technology that enabled Marines to complete their mission planted a curiosity in me that led to my career in computation.
