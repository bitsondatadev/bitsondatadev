### Hi there data alchemists 👋 💾 ⚗️

Did you know that [PrestoSQL](https://prestosql.io) is now [Trino](https://trino.io)!? 😲

**What's a Presto or a Trino?** Fast distributed data engine that runs fast interactive SQL queries over multiple data sources (S3, HDFS, elasticsearch, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc..)

**Why is this happening?** <a href="https://trino.io/blog/2020/12/27/announcing-trino.html" target="_blank">Read this blog</a> to find out more. 

**Wait is the software changing?** No, same software and community under a different banner, unless you're on prestodb.

**Wait what's prestodb vs prestosql?** That's all explained in <a href="https://trino.io/blog/2020/12/27/announcing-trino.html" target="_blank">the blog</a> as well.

**Which one am I on?** If your version is 300 - 350(and above), you're on Trino (formerly PrestoSQL), if your version is 0.54 (or above) you need to look at the namespace of the logs of your system. If you see io.prestosql or io.trinodb, you're on Trino, otherwise you're on PrestoDB.

**I use Athena, which is powered by Presto, does it use Trino?** Athena is a distribution of Presto maintained by Amazon that derives from a version common to both Trino and PrestoDB.

**Which do you recommend?** I personally chose Trino (PrestoSQL) in the company I worked at before Starburst because it's where the most growth is happening, it's where the founders and people who have committed most to both projects currently work, and frankly, it handles a wider breadth of use cases currently.

Oh, about me?

I'm a 🎖️👨 U.S. Marine turned 👨‍💻 Software Engineer and Developer Advocate working with the open-source [Trino](trino.io) ([formerly PrestoSQL](https://trino.io/blog/2020/12/27/announcing-trino.html)) community. Follow the 🐇!

I'm a computer nerd that absolutely ❤️ s ☕. Yes it's trite...but I'm owning it.

<strong style='font-size:2rem;'>About Me </strong>

My primary interests are in the underlying algorithms of ⚙️🗄️ database systems, 💽🔎 data analytics, and 📈📊 data visualization. I've spent four years as a Data Engineer at a cybersecurity company working on pipeline maintenance and query optimization. While in this role, I was responsible for maintaining data pipelines and migrations to include replacing some legacy data warehousing systems to use open-source [Trino](trino.io). I enjoy playing guitar🎸, maps/GIS systems🗺️, oxford commas🔣, and long walks on the beach🏖️.

- 🔭 I make community streamcasts 📺/ podcasts 🎙️ for Trino users. Check it out https://trino.io/broadcast/. Next goal is to make a Trino course!

- 🌱 I’m currently improving my ✍️ writing and getting even more involved with the community and learning more about how Trino works and how users use it!

</p>
I served six years in the Marine Corps and got out with an honorable discharge as a Sergeant. During that time my job was to maintain data communications 📡 through networking systems for a battalion for field operations. Experiencing the technology that enabled Marines to complete their mission planted a curiosity in me that led to my career in computation.
