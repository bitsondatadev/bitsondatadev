### Hi there data alchemists 👋 💾 ⚗️

I'm a 🔫👨 U.S. Marine turned 👨‍💻 Software Engineer and Developer 🥑 (Advocate) working to foster the open source Presto community. 

I served six years in the Marine Corps and got out with an honorable discharge as a Sergeant. During that time my job was to maintain data communications 📡 through networking systems for a battalion for field operations. Experiencing the technology that enabled Marines to complete their mission planted a curiosity in me that led to my career in computation. 

My primary interests are in the underlying algorithms of ⚙️🗄️ database systems, 💽🔎 data analytics, and 📈📊 data visualization. I've spent four years as a Data Engineer at a cybersecurity company working on pipeline maintenance and query optimization. While in this role, I was responsible for maintaining data pipelines and migrations to include replacing some legacy data warehousing systems to use open-source Presto. 

- 💻 I’m currently working on creating a community streamcast/podcast for Presto users.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning all the social medias and improving my ✍️ writing.
